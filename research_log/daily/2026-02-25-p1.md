# 2026-02-25 (P1 session)

## Work Done

- Implemented `notebooks/meanreversion_trend_filter.ipynb`
- Tested 5 variants of `BollingerMeanReversion` on 1h BTC/USDT Jan–Jun 2024:
  - Unfiltered
  - ADX ranging (sit out when ADX >= 25)
  - Slope flat (sit out when slope is trending)
  - Slope aligned (trade only when slope direction is consistent with signal)
  - ADX + aligned (both conditions)

## Findings

### F4 — MeanReversion underperforms on Jan–Jun 2024 (extended period)

`BollingerMeanReversion` returned **-9.1%** over Jan–Jun 2024 vs **+15.9%**
over Jan–Mar 2024 (same strategy, different window). The Q2 2024 BTC bull run
(price from ~42k → ~70k) caused repeated losses: the strategy kept going short
on overbought signals that never reversed.

**This partially invalidates F1**: MeanReversion's edge was period-specific,
not structural. It thrived in the ranging Jan–Feb 2024 market and was
destroyed by the trending Q2 rally.

### F5 — Trend filters did NOT help MeanReversion (hypothesis rejected)

**Hypothesis:** sit out trending regimes → reduce trending losses → improve MeanReversion.
**Result:** all filters made performance worse, not better.

| Variant | Return | Sharpe | Max DD |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unfiltered | -9.1% | -0.76 | -17.1% |
| ADX ranging | -17.5% | -2.70 | -21.9% |
| Slope flat | -13.3% | -2.20 | -16.7% |
| Slope aligned | -12.3% | -1.96 | -15.8% |
| ADX + aligned | -10.0% | -2.22 | -11.9% |

**Root cause:** in a strongly trending bull market, the strategy loses on *almost every trade*
regardless of regime. Filtering out trending bars only reduces the number of trades —
it does not fix the underlying problem that mean reversion doesn't work in a bull run.
The `ADX + aligned` filter did reduce max drawdown (-11.9% vs -17.1%) — some value,
but not enough to overcome the core strategy failure.

**Implication:** the right fix for MeanReversion in a bull market is not a filter —
it's a directional bias (only take long signals, no shorts) or a regime switch
(stop trading entirely when the overall trend is strongly up).

## Open Questions

- Would a **long-only MeanReversion** (only buy dips, never short rallies) perform
  better in bull markets while keeping the ranging-market edge?
- Would an **overall trend detector** (e.g. 200-bar MA slope) be a better regime
  switch than bar-by-bar ADX?
- Is the Jan–Mar 2024 result genuinely good or just a lucky in-sample window?
  Need walk-forward validation (P4).

## Revised Roadmap Impact

- P1 is **complete** but hypothesis was **rejected** — update roadmap
- New high-priority candidate: **long-only MeanReversion** variant
- **Walk-forward validation (P4)** now feels more urgent — results are too
  period-dependent to trust without out-of-sample testing
