## Work Done

- Implemented `backtesting/metrics.py` — 14 equity-curve metrics including
  Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, max drawdown, percentiles, win rate
- Restructured `strategies/` into `single/`, `pairs/`, `arbitrage/` hierarchy
  with `basic/` and `advanced/` sub-levels
- Implemented `strategies/single/basic/bollinger_bands.py`:
  - `BollingerMeanReversion` — long below lower band, short above upper band
  - `BollingerBreakout` — long above upper band, short below lower band
- Created `notebooks/bollinger_backtest.ipynb` — full backtest with signal
  charts, equity curves, metrics comparison, and market correlation analysis
- Implemented `signals/` package with `BaseSignal` abstract class
- Implemented `signals/trend/adx.py` — Wilder's ADX + DI lines
- Implemented `signals/trend/ma_slope.py` — normalised MA slope
- Created `notebooks/trend_signals_backtest.ipynb` — signal visualisation,
  filtered backtest, and prediction precision evaluation

## Findings

- **[F1]** `BollingerMeanReversion` significantly outperformed `BollingerBreakout`
  on 1h BTC/USDT Jan–Jun 2024 (Sharpe ~2.0 vs ~0.75)
- **[F2]** Applying `ADXTrend` and `MASlopeTrend` as filters to `BollingerBreakout`
  made performance worse — lagging indicators remove the entry edge on a momentum strategy
- **[F3]** Both trend signals predicted next-bar direction with ~0.47 accuracy
  (below random) on 1h data; accuracy degraded at longer horizons (4, 12, 24 bars)

## Open Questions

- Would the same trend filters *improve* `BollingerMeanReversion`? (P1)
- Do the signals have better predictive power on 4h or daily bars? (P3)
- Are the Bollinger results robust out-of-sample, or specific to this period?

## Next Steps

See [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) — P1 is the highest priority.
