# Research Log

A structured record of experiments, findings, and priorities for the crypto-trading-lab project.

## Structure

```
research_log/
├── README.md       — this file
├── roadmap.md      — current priority list (always up to date)
├── findings.md     — cumulative index of confirmed findings
└── daily/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

## How to use

- **Starting a session**: check `roadmap.md` for current priorities
- **During a session**: note what you run and any intermediate findings in the daily log
- **Ending a session**: update the daily log with findings, update `findings.md` if something
  meaningful was confirmed, update `roadmap.md` to reflect new priorities

## Daily log template
