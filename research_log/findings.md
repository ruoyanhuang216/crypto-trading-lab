## F1 — MeanReversion outperforms Breakout on 1h BTC (Jan–Jun 2024)
**Date:** 2026-02-25 | **Ref:** [2026-02-25](daily/2026-02-25.md)

`BollingerMeanReversion` (Sharpe ~2.0) significantly outperformed `BollingerBreakout`
(Sharpe ~0.75) on 1h BTC/USDT over Jan–Jun 2024.

**Hypothesis:** BTC was range-bound in Jan–Feb 2024 before the bull run,
favouring mean-reversion entries. Result may not hold in strongly trending periods.

**To validate:** rerun on a different time window (e.g. 2023 bear market, 2024 Q3 bull run).

## F2 — Lagging trend filters hurt BollingerBreakout
**Date:** 2026-02-25 | **Ref:** [2026-02-25](daily/2026-02-25.md)

Applying `ADXTrend` and `MASlopeTrend` filters to `BollingerBreakout` degraded
performance across all variants (unfiltered was the best).

**Root cause:** Breakout strategies need to enter at the *start* of a move.
ADX/slope are lagging — they confirm trends after the move is already underway,
removing the entry edge.

**Implication:** These signals should be tested as filters for *mean-reversion*
strategies instead (sit out when strongly trending), where the logic is aligned.

## F3 — Trend signals have sub-random directional accuracy at 1h
**Date:** 2026-02-25 | **Ref:** [2026-02-25](daily/2026-02-25.md)

Both `ADXTrend` and `MASlopeTrend` predicted next-bar direction with ~0.47 accuracy
on 1h BTC data — below the 0.5 random baseline. Accuracy degraded further at 4, 12,
and 24-bar horizons. Tightening thresholds reduced coverage without improving precision.

**Implication:** These signals should not be used as standalone directional forecasters
on 1h data. Their value is as **regime classifiers** (trending vs ranging market),
not as price direction predictors.

**To validate:** test on 4h or daily bars to check if signal quality improves at
lower frequencies where noise is reduced.
